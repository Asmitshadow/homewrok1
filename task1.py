#Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
#Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
#1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
#2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
#o	Addition
#o	Subtraction
#o	Multiplication
#o	Division
#3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.


first_number =  80

second_number =  16 

a = first_number+second_number
b = first_number-second_number
c= first_number*second_number
d= first_number/second_number

print("first_number =", 80 , " and second_number =", 16)
print("addition =", a)
print("subtraction =",b)
print("Multiplication = " , c)
print("Division =" ,float(d))


           # by input tag

# addition

x =int(input("Enter first number: "))
y = int(input("Enter second number: "))

result = x + y
print("Addition =", result)


#Substraction

x1 =  int(input("Enter first number:  "))
y1 =  int(input("Enter second number: "))

result1 = x1 - y1
print("substraction =", result1)

# Multiplication

x2 =  int(input("Enter first number:  "))
y2 =  int(input("Enter second number: "))

result2 = x2 * y2
print("multiplication =", result2)


#Divison


x3 =  int(input("Enter first number:  "))
y3 =  int(input("Enter second number: "))

result3 = x3 / y3
print("division =", result)
